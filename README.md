# AgroAI Colombia: Intelligent Agricultural Advisory System

![AgroAI Colombia Banner](docs/banner.png)  <!-- You can create and add a banner image here -->

## Overview

AgroAI Colombia is an intelligent agricultural advisory system designed to empower Colombian farmers with data-driven insights for crop management, pest detection, and climate-adaptive farming strategies. By leveraging the power of generative AI, this project provides real-time, personalized recommendations to help farmers improve crop yields, reduce costs, and build resilience against the effects of climate change.

This project is built to address Colombia's national priorities in agriculture, sustainability, and rural development, with a focus on supporting the smallholder farmers who form the backbone of the nation's agricultural sector.

## Features

*   **Intelligent Crop Recommendations**: Get recommendations for the best crops to plant based on your location, soil type, and the current season.
*   **Pest and Disease Detection**: Upload images of your plants to detect pests and identify diseases with high accuracy.
*   **Climate-Adaptive Strategies**: Receive weather forecasts and proactive advice on how to adapt your farming practices to changing climate conditions.
*   **Market Intelligence**: Get real-time market prices for your crops and predictions on future market trends.
*   **Comprehensive Advice**: Receive a synthesized report that combines all the insights from the different agents to give you a holistic view of your farm.

## Architecture

The AgroAI Colombia system is built on a modular, agent-based architecture. Each agent is a specialized AI model that is responsible for a specific task. The agents are orchestrated by a central API, which exposes the system's functionality through a set of RESTful endpoints.

The project also includes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which allows the agents to access a vast knowledge base of agricultural information.
